# 🚀 Performance Testing Framework

## 📘 Overview
This project provides a **Performance Testing Framework** designed to validate the **scalability, stability, and responsiveness** of the target APIs.  
It includes load testing scripts, environment setup configurations, automated execution pipeline, and a sample performance analysis report.

## 📂 Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Description |
|---|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Performance Test Scripts** | Load testing scripts created using `<Tool Name>` (e.g., JMeter, k6, Gatling). |
| 2 | **README.md** | Setup instructions and explanation of framework structure. |
| 3 | **Sample Execution Report** | A detailed performance test report with observations and analysis. |
| 4 | **CI/CD Pipeline Config** | YAML configuration to automate performance test execution via `<CI/CD Tool>` (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions). |
| 5 | **Setup Files** | Docker, environment variables, and configuration scripts for replicating the test setup. |

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed before running the tests:

- **Java 8+ / Node.js / Python** (based on tool used)
- **Docker** (for API setup)
- **Git**
- **<Tool Name>** (e.g., Apache JMeter / k6 / Gatling)
- **<CI/CD Tool>** (optional, for automated runs)
